#Habit Tracker
Problem Statement

Instructions

You are ALLOWED to research and read about how to approach the problem.
DO NOT copy and paste code from the internet.
DO NOT cheat with other students. Remember, these tests are for your learning. Cheating won’t help.
It’s better to not submit the solution than to cheat and submit. Plagiarism checks will be performed, and cheating will lead to disqualification.
Submission Guidelines
Record a video explaining your code and showcasing all features of the final product. The video should be up to 5 minutes long.
Upload the code to GitHub.
If hosting is required, further steps will be provided.
